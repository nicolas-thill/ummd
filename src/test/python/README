This is the Management Tool to monitor and control UMMD nodes.

To test it, you'll need the following :
    - python 2.6
    - twisted

= How to use it =

First, you need to launch the script ummd-node.py to emulate one or
more UMMD nodes :
    % ./ummd-node.py

Finally, launch the script ummc.py :
    % ./ummc.py

The script ummc will send "Ping?" messages every 2 seconds on
224.0.0.1 and every ummd-node will answer with a simple "Pong?".
